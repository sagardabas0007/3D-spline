In this project, I integrated Framer Motion, GSAP, and a 3D element from Spline to explore advanced animation techniques and interactive design. The primary goal was to gain hands-on experience with incorporating Spline 3D models into a web application while enhancing the overall user experience through smooth, engaging animations.
